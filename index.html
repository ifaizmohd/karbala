                        Karbala is a city in central Iraq, located about 100Km
                        (62 miles) southwest of Baghdad, and few dozen miles
                        east of lake Milh. Karbala is the capital of Karbala
                        Governorate.
                        The city is best known as the location of the Battle of
                        Karbala in 680 CE (61 Hijri), or the shrines of Imam
                        Hussain a.s and Hazrat Abbas a.s, is considered a holy
                        city for Shi’ite Muslims, in the same way as Mecca,
                        Medina and Jerusalem.

                    <p>There are many opinions among different investigators, as
                        to the origin of the word "Karbala". Some have pointed
                        out that "Karbala" has a connection to the "Karbalato"
                        language, while others attempt to derive the meaning of
                        word "Karbala" by analyzing its spelling and language.
                        They conclude that it originates from the Arabic word
                        "Kar Babel" which was a group of ancient Babylonian
                        villages that included Nainawa, Al-Ghadiriyya, Karbella,
                        Al-Nawaweess, and
                        Al-Heer. This last name is today known as Al-Hair and is
                        where Husayn ibn Ali's grave is located.</p>

                    <h2>Highlights of Battle of <span class="red">Karbala</span>.</h2>
                    <p>The events of Karbala reflect the collision of the good
                        versus the evil, the virtuous versus the wicked, and the
                        collision of Imam Husayn (the head of virtue) versus
                        Yazid
                        (the head of impiety). Al-Husayn was a revolutionary
                        person,
                        a righteous man, the religious authority, the Imam of
                        Muslim
                        Ummah.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the representative of his grandfather Prophet Muhammad
                        (S), Imam Husayn's main concern was to safeguard and
                        protect
                        Islam and guide fellow Muslims. On the other hand, the
                        staying power of the rulers (Mu'awiya and his son Yazid)
                        depended solely on the might of the sword. They used
                        brute
                        force to rule over the Muslim empire even by all
                        possible
                        illicit means.</p>
                    <p>Imam Husayn as head of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) never recognized
                        Mu'awiya nor his followers. Before him Imam ‘Ali (a.s.)
                        had
                        fought battles against Mu'awiya because Mu'awiya
                        continuously violated the Islamic principles. Imam
                        Al-Hasan
                        (a.s.) had to swallow the bitter pill of making a peace
                        agreement with Mu'awiya, in order to safeguard the
                        security
                        of the Ummah which was at stake.</p>
                    <p>When Yazid son of Mu'awiya declared himself as a ruler
                        over the Ummah, he demanded Imam Al-Husayn's (a.s.)
                        allegiance of loyalty. Imam Husayn on his part flatly
                        rejected Yazid's rule and behavior, for there was no way
                        Yazid could represent Islam, it would be blasphemy. But
                        Yazid, the tyrant ruler over the Ummah, was adamant in
                        his demand, and tension between the two parties
                        increased day by day.</p>
                    <p>Imam Husayn was quick to realize that giving allegiance
                        of loyalty to Yazid would serve no purpose but to
                        jeopardize the survival of Islam. To safeguard and
                        protect Islam, therefore, the Imam had no choice but to
                        confront and collide with Yazid's rulership irrespective
                        of consequences. Since Yazid had ordered his commanders
                        to seize the Imam's allegiance of loyalty at any cost,
                        even by brutal force, the commanders had to assemble a
                        relatively large army, surrounding Imam Husayn's camp in
                        a desert called Karbala.</p>

                <h2>Who was Mu'awiya?</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya was son of Abu Sufyan, a leader of Bani Umayya
                        clan which was one of the clans of Quraish tribes.
                        Mu'awiya grew up in a family known to be cunning,
                        worldly, materialistic, and power hungry. Mu'awiya
                        became Muslim only when Prophet Muhammad (S) triumphed
                        over Mecca. Those who became Muslim in this manner were
                        called Tulaqaa', (a term scornfully used for the
                        disbelievers who became Muslims to save their lives).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya, his father Abu Sufyan, his mother Hind, and
                        his brother Yazid son of Abu Sufyan were all Tulaqaa';
                        Mu'awiya never forgot this stigma for the rest of his
                        life; he could never shake it from his mind, thus a
                        feeling of malicious vengeance always existed in his
                        heart. Mu'awiya's character and aspirations were
                        entirely opposite to that of his sister, Umm Habiba, who
                        was one of the wives of the Holy Prophet (S). Unlike
                        Mu'awiya, Umm Habiba was a sincere believer and a pious
                        person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Omar, the second Khalifa, appointed Mu'awiya's brother,
                        Yazid son of Abu Sufyan, as the Governor of Syria when
                        the Muslims captured that territory from the Byzantines.
                        Within a few years, Yazid son of Abu Sufyan died of a
                        disease, and Omar appointed Mu'awiya in his brother's
                        place as the Governor. Upon coming to power, Mu'awiya
                        took advantage of the rich public treasury of Syria
                        using it personally to buy favors and influence people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus he built a large base of support among some tribes,
                        almost to the fanatic level. He used this to his
                        advantage in later years to form a network of informants
                        (spies) against Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) and their devotees.

                <h2>Jamal Confrontation.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        When Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) became Khalifa, he decided to
                        remove Mu'awiya immediately, notwithstanding Mu'awiya's
                        strong base of support. At that time, Mu'awiya had been
                        the governor of Syria, Palestine, and Jordan for 17
                        years. Mu'awiya became defiant, he refused to obey
                        ‘Ali's orders. Brazen and unabashed, he even declined to
                        recognize ‘Ali or give allegiance of loyalty to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also in defiance, Mu'awiya established a parallel
                        government in Greater Syria, and started a campaign of
                        treacherous accusations and malicious rumors against
                        Imam ‘Ali (a.s.). He falsely blamed Imam ‘Ali for the
                        killing of Uthman, the third Khalifa, and urged people
                        to take up arms against the Imam. He spread these
                        notorious accusations constantly to incite an uprising
                        against ‘Ali (a.s.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time A'isha, the Prophet's widow, became
                        highly vocal against Imam ‘Ali (a.s.). She called for
                        taking revenge for the blood of Uthman. As a result, a
                        party of 3,000 insurgents supported by Sahaaba
                        (Companions) such as Talha and Zubair, along with A'isha
                        headed toward Basrah. The insurgents upon reaching
                        Basrah clashed with the local authorities and finally
                        occupied a portion of Basrah. Soon after the occupation
                        these insurgents spread a reign of terror among the
                        people, killing no less than 600 local Muslims,
                        pilfering the treasury and stealing the arms supplies of
                        the armory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Khalifa in charge, Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) could not
                        ignore the situation, he had to act and restore peace
                        and order. He ordered his forces to proceed to Basrah.
                        As the Imam's forces reached near Basrah, Imam ‘Ali
                        (a.s.) tried to persuade the insurgents led by A'isha,
                        Zubair and Talha to change their minds and avoid
                        confrontation, but he did not succeed. A battle broke
                        out though Zubair elected not to fight; Talha was
                        wounded then bled to death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thousands of people lost their lives. A'isha fell down
                        from the camel after it was disabled; but luckily she
                        was not hurt. Imam ‘Ali asked Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr,
                        (A'isha's brother), to take A'isha to Basrah for a few
                        days, and from there to escort her to Medina with full
                        honor and dignity. Upon leaving Basrah Al-Hasan (a.s.)
                        and Al-Husayn (a.s.) accompanied the Prophet's widow for
                        some distance before bidding her farewell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) stayed in Basrah for a few weeks to
                        restore law and order. He compensated for the dead, and
                        decided to forgive and absolve all who fought against
                        him, exactly as the Prophet (S) had done when he
                        triumphed over Mecca 40 years earlier.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Upon returning to Kufa, Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) immediately
                        prepared for the anticipated clash with Mu'awiya. The
                        defying Mu'awiya continued to violate the Islamic
                        principles by personally using the public treasury for
                        espionage and buying peoples' loyalty. The people of
                        Syria fully believed him and the in false picture he
                        presented. Ultimately this resulted in a confrontation
                        called Battle of Siffin when the troops of the two sides
                        met at Siffin.

                        The battle saw ferocious fighting for nine days when
                        Mu'awiya's forces were near collapse. His troops were
                        fleeing and in disarray, and their retreat was in
                        massive disorder, running helter skelter. Mu'awiya was
                        alarmed, tense and frightened, preparing to run away,
                        when he learned of a clever trick. The trick was
                        indecent and unbecoming, it was to make the Holy Quran
                        as an instrument and exploit it, to use it as a tool to
                        his advantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya seized on this immediately and commanded his
                        fighters to raise 500 Holy Qurans on tips of spears, in
                        order to stun the troops of Imam ‘Ali. As jolting as it
                        was, this maneuver did break the onslaught and the
                        momentum of ‘Ali's fighters, for they were very pious
                        men. But Imam ‘Ali was quick to recognize this deceit,
                        he knew how deceptive Mu'awiya was, and now that being
                        near collapse, Mu'awiya wanted to save his neck at the
                        expense of the Quran itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that in mind, ‘Ali (a.s.) urged his generals not to
                        halt, but to keep fighting since victory was almost at
                        hand. Alas, ‘Ali's generals and fighters were in shock,
                        for the sight of the Holy Quran high on spear heads was
                        startling to say the least. They could not take it. Not
                        willing to fight, they wanted to accept Mu'awiya's offer
                        to halt the fighting and negotiate instead. The
                        termination of the battle in this manner and the
                        consequences thereof proved to be disastrous to say the
                        least, especially for Ahlul Bayt and Islam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is said that there was a conspiracy between Amr Ibnil
                        Aas of Mu'awiya's side, and Ash'ath Ibn Qais, a General
                        in Imam ‘Ali's camp, who was working as a spy against
                        ‘Ali, secretly working as an agent for Mu'awiya. In this
                        battle 45,000 men lost their lives in Mu'awiya's camp,
                        and about 25,000 in ‘Ali's (a.s.) camp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many men of high caliber from both sides died,
                        especially Ammar Ibn Yasir, the great Companion of the
                        Prophet (S), who was 90 years old and fought on Imam
                        ‘Ali's side against Mu'awiya.

                <h2>After Siffin.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Imam ‘Ali's (a.s.) generals, who stopped the battle to
                        negotiate with Mu'awiya, did not pick the right person
                        for the negotiation. They unyieldingly refused to accept
                        Imam ‘Ali's choice, instead they picked Kufa's Governor,
                        Abu-Musa Ash'ari, an incompetent Governor who had been
                        previously dismissed from office by Imam ‘Ali. Mu'awiya
                        appointed Amr Ibnil Aas, a shrewd and cunning man, to be
                        his representative in the negotiation. Negotiation
                        between the two sides did not take place for about one
                        year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the two negotiators came face to face, it was clear
                        that Ash'ari's capability was no match for his opponent
                        Ibnil Aas. In the negotiations, Ash'ari proposed that,
                        both Mu'awiya and Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) were to abdicate and
                        to let the people hold election for the Khilaafah. Amr
                        Ibnil Aas, a deceptive man at best, quickly agreed to
                        Ash'ari's proposal and asked Ash'ari to first announce
                        the agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ash'ari stood up and announced, "O people, we have
                        agreed not to consider ‘Ali or Mu'awiya for Khilaafah.
                        You may choose or elect whomever you think is fit." The
                        cunning Amr Ibnil Aas stood up next to say, "O people! I
                        won't consider ‘Ali for the Khilaafah. But Mu'awiya, in
                        my opinion, is the person for that office!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon hearing this (and feeling deceived), the people
                        screamed disapprovingly, an uproar was the result. Imam
                        ‘Ali's (a.s.) camp was in shock, they were
                        double-crossed, deceived and lied to, they felt deeply
                        cut. Amr's double crossing and deception was simply
                        beyond their imagination. They left the place bewildered
                        and utterly disappointed. Because of this a large group
                        of Imam ‘Ali's supporters defected to form a separate
                        group called Kharijies, meaning the Outsiders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Khariji became fanatically opposed to Imam ‘Ali and
                        Mu'awiya. Some of their members met secretly in Mecca
                        and drew a plan to assassinate ‘Ali (a.s.) in Kufa,
                        Mu'awiya in Syria, and Amr Ibnil Aas in Egypt. Three
                        fanatics took the responsibility, they were to attack
                        their victims in the morning, the same day, as the
                        would-be victims were going to the mosque to lead the
                        morning salat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ibn Muljim attacked and fatally wounded Imam ‘Ali
                        (a.s.), whereas Mu'awiya escaped with a light wound of
                        his buttock. Amr Ibnil Aas was ill that day and his
                        replacement was killed by the Khariji. Imam ‘Ali (a.s.),
                        in wounded condition, conferred the Imamah and the reign
                        of the Islamic nation to his 37 years old son Al-Hasan.

                <h2>Peace Agreement Between Imam Al-Hasan And Mu'awiya.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Imam Hasan (a.s.) faced extremely difficult conditions
                        from the start. He observed that fear, anxiety and much
                        distress were ever present in Kufa, Basrah, Medina and
                        other towns. The anxiety, uncertainty and insecurity
                        were caused by Mu'awiya's ill dealing of sincere
                        Muslims. Mu'awiya had spread secret agents all over to
                        defame Ahlul Bayt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam Hasan knew that his father Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) had
                        stood like a lion in all difficulties and fought battles
                        against Mu'awiya, but these confrontations had resulted
                        in heavy casualties on both sides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A mass scale family devastation was visible everywhere.
                        Considering all circumstances, Imam Hasan (a.s.)
                        discussed the matter with his brother Husayn (a.s.) and
                        other relatives. He revealed to them that in order to
                        end the bloodshed and to provide a reasonable safety and
                        security to the Ummah, he would make a peace agreement
                        with Mu'awiya and abdicate until after Mu'awiya's death.
                        After a few days of careful consideration, Imam Hasan
                        (a.s.) accepted an agreement as per the terms dictated
                        by the Imam and agreed to by Mu'awiya. Four noteworthy
                        terms of this agreement were:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - People of Syria, Iraq, Hijaz, Yemen and other places
                        shall enjoy amnesty against persecution,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Friends and companions of Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) and all
                        their women and children shall be protected from all
                        dangers,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Mu'awiya is to immediately stop the use of abusive
                        language with reference to Ahlul Bayt (cursing Imam
                        ‘Ali) after Salat of Jumu'a), and
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Mu'awiya shall not appoint anyone as his successor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the treaty was signed, Imam Hasan (a.s.) and
                        brother Husayn (a.s.) moved out of Kufa and settled in
                        Medina. Over there both Imams lost no time in holding
                        nightly meetings for Islamic discussions. The nightly
                        meetings proved very successful and gained tremendous
                        popularity. More people started to attend, to hear the
                        Imams give of their fountain of knowledge on Islam and
                        humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reputation of these meetings began to fly to faraway
                        places. People from as far away as Egypt, Iraq, Yemen,
                        and other distant areas travelled to Medina to learn
                        about the Islamic values. As years passed, the knowledge
                        thus given started to bear fruits. The number of Islamic
                        scholars multiplied and increased considerably.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the meantime Mu'awiya, unabashedly elected to
                        disregard the terms of his treaty with Imam Al-Hasan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        a) He sent secret agents to terrorize, kidnap, or even
                        kill innocent people specially those who were loyal to
                        Ahlul Bayt (a.s.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b) Instead of helping the needy with the public
                        treasury, Mu'awiya's governors and their surrogates used
                        the public treasury for personal use, freely and
                        excessively as they wished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c) Freedom suddenly died, and dictatorship took its
                        place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        d) Mu'awiya gathered a very large number of
                        collaborators who unabashedly would do anything for
                        money.
                    </p>

                <h2>Mu'awiya's Plot to Poison Imam Hasan (a.s.).</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        It was Mu'awiya's ardent desire to impose his son Yazid
                        (who had been named after his uncle) upon the Muslims by
                        making him the succeeding Khalifa, despite the fact that
                        Yazid was the playboy of the time, with many evil habits
                        including gambling, heavy drinking, and indulgence in
                        the pleasures of the flesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the peace agreement would not permit Mu'awiya to
                        appoint Yazid as his successor, (According to the
                        agreement Imam Hasan would immediately become Khalifa
                        upon Mu'awiya's death). Therefore, it was obvious to
                        Mu'awiya that, if Al-Hasan did not outlive him, Mu'awiya
                        could do as he pleased. Thus Mu'awiya planned to kill
                        Imam Al-Hasan in order to pave the way for his son Yazid
                        to be his successor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya sent one of his agents to contact Imam
                        Al-Hasan's wife Joda who was the daughter of Al-Ash'ath
                        (once a secret agent for Mu'awiya against Imam ‘Ali in
                        the Battle of Siffin). Joda was asked a small favor,
                        i.e., to put a little poison in Al-Hasan's food, and in
                        return Mu'awiya would give her a large sum of money and
                        also make her wife of his son Yazid. She found the offer
                        too attractive to ignore, and foolishly agreed to accept
                        it. A few days later, she mixed poison in honey and gave
                        it to the Imam.
                    </p>

                        As soon as the Imam took the poisoned honey he became
                        seriously ill. Sensing that his death was imminent, the
                        Imam designated his brother Al-Husayn (a.s.) to be the
                        third Imam. Although Imam Al-Hasan knew he was poisoned,
                        he did not reveal that to anyone but to his brother
                        Al-Husayn.

                        One thing Al-Hasan had wished was to have his burial by
                        the side of his grandfather, Prophet Muhammad (S). Imam
                        Husayn made all the arrangements to fulfill that wish
                        but Mu'awiya's governor over Medina did not let that
                        happen and used military force to stop it. Imam Al-Hasan
                        was 47 year old when he died of poisoning.

                        Medina was never the same without Imam Hasan (a.s.).
                        Everyone missed him dearly. People at first did not
                        believe Mu'awiya poisoned Imam Al-Hasan, but soon found
                        out the truth.

                    <p>
                        When Husayn (a.s.) was designated as the 3rd Imam he was
                        46 years old. Imam Husayn (a.s.) carried on with his
                        mission of teaching Islam as before. A large number of
                        people kept coming to see him and to learn from him.
                        This process continued for several years when people
                        began to hear an ugly rumor that Mu'awiya wanted his
                        son, Yazid, to succeed him.
