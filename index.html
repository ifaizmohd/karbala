                    <p>
                        Karbala is a city in central Iraq, located about 100Km
                        (62 miles) southwest of Baghdad, and few dozen miles
                        east of lake Milh. Karbala is the capital of Karbala
                        Governorate.
                        The city is best known as the location of the Battle of
                        Karbala in 680 CE (61 Hijri), or the shrines of Imam
                        Hussain a.s and Hazrat Abbas a.s, is considered a holy
                        city for Shi’ite Muslims, in the same way as Mecca,
                        Medina and Jerusalem.

                    <p>There are many opinions among different investigators, as
                        to the origin of the word "Karbala". Some have pointed
                        out that "Karbala" has a connection to the "Karbalato"
                        language, while others attempt to derive the meaning of
                        word "Karbala" by analyzing its spelling and language.
                        They conclude that it originates from the Arabic word
                        "Kar Babel" which was a group of ancient Babylonian
                        villages that included Nainawa, Al-Ghadiriyya, Karbella,
                        Al-Nawaweess, and
                        Al-Heer. This last name is today known as Al-Hair and is
                        where Husayn ibn Ali's grave is located.</p>

                    <h2>Highlights of Battle of <span class="red">Karbala</span>.</h2>
                    <p>The events of Karbala reflect the collision of the good
                        versus the evil, the virtuous versus the wicked, and the
                        collision of Imam Husayn (the head of virtue) versus
                        Yazid
                        (the head of impiety). Al-Husayn was a revolutionary
                        person,
                        a righteous man, the religious authority, the Imam of
                        Muslim
                        Ummah.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the representative of his grandfather Prophet Muhammad
                        (S), Imam Husayn's main concern was to safeguard and
                        protect
                        Islam and guide fellow Muslims. On the other hand, the
                        staying power of the rulers (Mu'awiya and his son Yazid)
                        depended solely on the might of the sword. They used
                        brute
                        force to rule over the Muslim empire even by all
                        possible
                        illicit means.</p>
                    <p>Imam Husayn as head of Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) never recognized
                        Mu'awiya nor his followers. Before him Imam ‘Ali (a.s.)
                        had
                        fought battles against Mu'awiya because Mu'awiya
                        continuously violated the Islamic principles. Imam
                        Al-Hasan
                        (a.s.) had to swallow the bitter pill of making a peace
                        agreement with Mu'awiya, in order to safeguard the
                        security
                        of the Ummah which was at stake.</p>
                    <p>When Yazid son of Mu'awiya declared himself as a ruler
                        over the Ummah, he demanded Imam Al-Husayn's (a.s.)
                        allegiance of loyalty. Imam Husayn on his part flatly
                        rejected Yazid's rule and behavior, for there was no way
                        Yazid could represent Islam, it would be blasphemy. But
                        Yazid, the tyrant ruler over the Ummah, was adamant in
                        his demand, and tension between the two parties
                        increased day by day.</p>
                    <p>Imam Husayn was quick to realize that giving allegiance
                        of loyalty to Yazid would serve no purpose but to
                        jeopardize the survival of Islam. To safeguard and
                        protect Islam, therefore, the Imam had no choice but to
                        confront and collide with Yazid's rulership irrespective
                        of consequences. Since Yazid had ordered his commanders
                        to seize the Imam's allegiance of loyalty at any cost,
                        even by brutal force, the commanders had to assemble a
                        relatively large army, surrounding Imam Husayn's camp in
                        a desert called Karbala.</p>

                <h2>Who was Mu'awiya?</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya was son of Abu Sufyan, a leader of Bani Umayya
                        clan which was one of the clans of Quraish tribes.
                        Mu'awiya grew up in a family known to be cunning,
                        worldly, materialistic, and power hungry. Mu'awiya
                        became Muslim only when Prophet Muhammad (S) triumphed
                        over Mecca. Those who became Muslim in this manner were
                        called Tulaqaa', (a term scornfully used for the
                        disbelievers who became Muslims to save their lives).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya, his father Abu Sufyan, his mother Hind, and
                        his brother Yazid son of Abu Sufyan were all Tulaqaa';
                        Mu'awiya never forgot this stigma for the rest of his
                        life; he could never shake it from his mind, thus a
                        feeling of malicious vengeance always existed in his
                        heart. Mu'awiya's character and aspirations were
                        entirely opposite to that of his sister, Umm Habiba, who
                        was one of the wives of the Holy Prophet (S). Unlike
                        Mu'awiya, Umm Habiba was a sincere believer and a pious
                        person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Omar, the second Khalifa, appointed Mu'awiya's brother,
                        Yazid son of Abu Sufyan, as the Governor of Syria when
                        the Muslims captured that territory from the Byzantines.
                        Within a few years, Yazid son of Abu Sufyan died of a
                        disease, and Omar appointed Mu'awiya in his brother's
                        place as the Governor. Upon coming to power, Mu'awiya
                        took advantage of the rich public treasury of Syria
                        using it personally to buy favors and influence people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus he built a large base of support among some tribes,
                        almost to the fanatic level. He used this to his
                        advantage in later years to form a network of informants
                        (spies) against Ahlul Bayt (a.s.) and their devotees.

                <h2>Jamal Confrontation.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        When Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) became Khalifa, he decided to
                        remove Mu'awiya immediately, notwithstanding Mu'awiya's
                        strong base of support. At that time, Mu'awiya had been
                        the governor of Syria, Palestine, and Jordan for 17
                        years. Mu'awiya became defiant, he refused to obey
                        ‘Ali's orders. Brazen and unabashed, he even declined to
                        recognize ‘Ali or give allegiance of loyalty to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also in defiance, Mu'awiya established a parallel
                        government in Greater Syria, and started a campaign of
                        treacherous accusations and malicious rumors against
                        Imam ‘Ali (a.s.). He falsely blamed Imam ‘Ali for the
                        killing of Uthman, the third Khalifa, and urged people
                        to take up arms against the Imam. He spread these
                        notorious accusations constantly to incite an uprising
                        against ‘Ali (a.s.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time A'isha, the Prophet's widow, became
                        highly vocal against Imam ‘Ali (a.s.). She called for
                        taking revenge for the blood of Uthman. As a result, a
                        party of 3,000 insurgents supported by Sahaaba
                        (Companions) such as Talha and Zubair, along with A'isha
                        headed toward Basrah. The insurgents upon reaching
                        Basrah clashed with the local authorities and finally
                        occupied a portion of Basrah. Soon after the occupation
                        these insurgents spread a reign of terror among the
                        people, killing no less than 600 local Muslims,
                        pilfering the treasury and stealing the arms supplies of
                        the armory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Khalifa in charge, Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) could not
                        ignore the situation, he had to act and restore peace
                        and order. He ordered his forces to proceed to Basrah.
                        As the Imam's forces reached near Basrah, Imam ‘Ali
                        (a.s.) tried to persuade the insurgents led by A'isha,
                        Zubair and Talha to change their minds and avoid
                        confrontation, but he did not succeed. A battle broke
                        out though Zubair elected not to fight; Talha was
                        wounded then bled to death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thousands of people lost their lives. A'isha fell down
                        from the camel after it was disabled; but luckily she
                        was not hurt. Imam ‘Ali asked Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr,
                        (A'isha's brother), to take A'isha to Basrah for a few
                        days, and from there to escort her to Medina with full
                        honor and dignity. Upon leaving Basrah Al-Hasan (a.s.)
                        and Al-Husayn (a.s.) accompanied the Prophet's widow for
                        some distance before bidding her farewell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) stayed in Basrah for a few weeks to
                        restore law and order. He compensated for the dead, and
                        decided to forgive and absolve all who fought against
                        him, exactly as the Prophet (S) had done when he
                        triumphed over Mecca 40 years earlier.

                <h2>Battle of Siffin.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Upon returning to Kufa, Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) immediately
                        prepared for the anticipated clash with Mu'awiya. The
                        defying Mu'awiya continued to violate the Islamic
                        principles by personally using the public treasury for
                        espionage and buying peoples' loyalty. The people of
                        Syria fully believed him and the in false picture he
                        presented. Ultimately this resulted in a confrontation
                        called Battle of Siffin when the troops of the two sides
                        met at Siffin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The battle saw ferocious fighting for nine days when
                        Mu'awiya's forces were near collapse. His troops were
                        fleeing and in disarray, and their retreat was in
                        massive disorder, running helter skelter. Mu'awiya was
                        alarmed, tense and frightened, preparing to run away,
                        when he learned of a clever trick. The trick was
                        indecent and unbecoming, it was to make the Holy Quran
                        as an instrument and exploit it, to use it as a tool to
                        his advantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya seized on this immediately and commanded his
                        fighters to raise 500 Holy Qurans on tips of spears, in
                        order to stun the troops of Imam ‘Ali. As jolting as it
                        was, this maneuver did break the onslaught and the
                        momentum of ‘Ali's fighters, for they were very pious
                        men. But Imam ‘Ali was quick to recognize this deceit,
                        he knew how deceptive Mu'awiya was, and now that being
                        near collapse, Mu'awiya wanted to save his neck at the
                        expense of the Quran itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that in mind, ‘Ali (a.s.) urged his generals not to
                        halt, but to keep fighting since victory was almost at
                        hand. Alas, ‘Ali's generals and fighters were in shock,
                        for the sight of the Holy Quran high on spear heads was
                        startling to say the least. They could not take it. Not
                        willing to fight, they wanted to accept Mu'awiya's offer
                        to halt the fighting and negotiate instead. The
                        termination of the battle in this manner and the
                        consequences thereof proved to be disastrous to say the
                        least, especially for Ahlul Bayt and Islam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is said that there was a conspiracy between Amr Ibnil
                        Aas of Mu'awiya's side, and Ash'ath Ibn Qais, a General
                        in Imam ‘Ali's camp, who was working as a spy against
                        ‘Ali, secretly working as an agent for Mu'awiya. In this
                        battle 45,000 men lost their lives in Mu'awiya's camp,
                        and about 25,000 in ‘Ali's (a.s.) camp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many men of high caliber from both sides died,
                        especially Ammar Ibn Yasir, the great Companion of the
                        Prophet (S), who was 90 years old and fought on Imam
                        ‘Ali's side against Mu'awiya.

                <h2>After Siffin.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Imam ‘Ali's (a.s.) generals, who stopped the battle to
                        negotiate with Mu'awiya, did not pick the right person
                        for the negotiation. They unyieldingly refused to accept
                        Imam ‘Ali's choice, instead they picked Kufa's Governor,
                        Abu-Musa Ash'ari, an incompetent Governor who had been
                        previously dismissed from office by Imam ‘Ali. Mu'awiya
                        appointed Amr Ibnil Aas, a shrewd and cunning man, to be
                        his representative in the negotiation. Negotiation
                        between the two sides did not take place for about one
                        year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the two negotiators came face to face, it was clear
                        that Ash'ari's capability was no match for his opponent
                        Ibnil Aas. In the negotiations, Ash'ari proposed that,
                        both Mu'awiya and Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) were to abdicate and
                        to let the people hold election for the Khilaafah. Amr
                        Ibnil Aas, a deceptive man at best, quickly agreed to
                        Ash'ari's proposal and asked Ash'ari to first announce
                        the agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ash'ari stood up and announced, "O people, we have
                        agreed not to consider ‘Ali or Mu'awiya for Khilaafah.
                        You may choose or elect whomever you think is fit." The
                        cunning Amr Ibnil Aas stood up next to say, "O people! I
                        won't consider ‘Ali for the Khilaafah. But Mu'awiya, in
                        my opinion, is the person for that office!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon hearing this (and feeling deceived), the people
                        screamed disapprovingly, an uproar was the result. Imam
                        ‘Ali's (a.s.) camp was in shock, they were
                        double-crossed, deceived and lied to, they felt deeply
                        cut. Amr's double crossing and deception was simply
                        beyond their imagination. They left the place bewildered
                        and utterly disappointed. Because of this a large group
                        of Imam ‘Ali's supporters defected to form a separate
                        group called Kharijies, meaning the Outsiders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Khariji became fanatically opposed to Imam ‘Ali and
                        Mu'awiya. Some of their members met secretly in Mecca
                        and drew a plan to assassinate ‘Ali (a.s.) in Kufa,
                        Mu'awiya in Syria, and Amr Ibnil Aas in Egypt. Three
                        fanatics took the responsibility, they were to attack
                        their victims in the morning, the same day, as the
                        would-be victims were going to the mosque to lead the
                        morning salat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ibn Muljim attacked and fatally wounded Imam ‘Ali
                        (a.s.), whereas Mu'awiya escaped with a light wound of
                        his buttock. Amr Ibnil Aas was ill that day and his
                        replacement was killed by the Khariji. Imam ‘Ali (a.s.),
                        in wounded condition, conferred the Imamah and the reign
                        of the Islamic nation to his 37 years old son Al-Hasan.

                <h2>Peace Agreement Between Imam Al-Hasan And Mu'awiya.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Imam Hasan (a.s.) faced extremely difficult conditions
                        from the start. He observed that fear, anxiety and much
                        distress were ever present in Kufa, Basrah, Medina and
                        other towns. The anxiety, uncertainty and insecurity
                        were caused by Mu'awiya's ill dealing of sincere
                        Muslims. Mu'awiya had spread secret agents all over to
                        defame Ahlul Bayt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam Hasan knew that his father Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) had
                        stood like a lion in all difficulties and fought battles
                        against Mu'awiya, but these confrontations had resulted
                        in heavy casualties on both sides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A mass scale family devastation was visible everywhere.
                        Considering all circumstances, Imam Hasan (a.s.)
                        discussed the matter with his brother Husayn (a.s.) and
                        other relatives. He revealed to them that in order to
                        end the bloodshed and to provide a reasonable safety and
                        security to the Ummah, he would make a peace agreement
                        with Mu'awiya and abdicate until after Mu'awiya's death.
                        After a few days of careful consideration, Imam Hasan
                        (a.s.) accepted an agreement as per the terms dictated
                        by the Imam and agreed to by Mu'awiya. Four noteworthy
                        terms of this agreement were:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - People of Syria, Iraq, Hijaz, Yemen and other places
                        shall enjoy amnesty against persecution,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Friends and companions of Imam ‘Ali (a.s.) and all
                        their women and children shall be protected from all
                        dangers,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Mu'awiya is to immediately stop the use of abusive
                        language with reference to Ahlul Bayt (cursing Imam
                        ‘Ali) after Salat of Jumu'a), and
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Mu'awiya shall not appoint anyone as his successor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the treaty was signed, Imam Hasan (a.s.) and
                        brother Husayn (a.s.) moved out of Kufa and settled in
                        Medina. Over there both Imams lost no time in holding
                        nightly meetings for Islamic discussions. The nightly
                        meetings proved very successful and gained tremendous
                        popularity. More people started to attend, to hear the
                        Imams give of their fountain of knowledge on Islam and
                        humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reputation of these meetings began to fly to faraway
                        places. People from as far away as Egypt, Iraq, Yemen,
                        and other distant areas travelled to Medina to learn
                        about the Islamic values. As years passed, the knowledge
                        thus given started to bear fruits. The number of Islamic
                        scholars multiplied and increased considerably.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the meantime Mu'awiya, unabashedly elected to
                        disregard the terms of his treaty with Imam Al-Hasan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        a) He sent secret agents to terrorize, kidnap, or even
                        kill innocent people specially those who were loyal to
                        Ahlul Bayt (a.s.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b) Instead of helping the needy with the public
                        treasury, Mu'awiya's governors and their surrogates used
                        the public treasury for personal use, freely and
                        excessively as they wished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c) Freedom suddenly died, and dictatorship took its
                        place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        d) Mu'awiya gathered a very large number of
                        collaborators who unabashedly would do anything for
                        money.

                <h2>Mu'awiya's Plot to Poison Imam Hasan (a.s.).</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        It was Mu'awiya's ardent desire to impose his son Yazid
                        (who had been named after his uncle) upon the Muslims by
                        making him the succeeding Khalifa, despite the fact that
                        Yazid was the playboy of the time, with many evil habits
                        including gambling, heavy drinking, and indulgence in
                        the pleasures of the flesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the peace agreement would not permit Mu'awiya to
                        appoint Yazid as his successor, (According to the
                        agreement Imam Hasan would immediately become Khalifa
                        upon Mu'awiya's death). Therefore, it was obvious to
                        Mu'awiya that, if Al-Hasan did not outlive him, Mu'awiya
                        could do as he pleased. Thus Mu'awiya planned to kill
                        Imam Al-Hasan in order to pave the way for his son Yazid
                        to be his successor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya sent one of his agents to contact Imam
                        Al-Hasan's wife Joda who was the daughter of Al-Ash'ath
                        (once a secret agent for Mu'awiya against Imam ‘Ali in
                        the Battle of Siffin). Joda was asked a small favor,
                        i.e., to put a little poison in Al-Hasan's food, and in
                        return Mu'awiya would give her a large sum of money and
                        also make her wife of his son Yazid. She found the offer
                        too attractive to ignore, and foolishly agreed to accept
                        it. A few days later, she mixed poison in honey and gave
                        it to the Imam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As soon as the Imam took the poisoned honey he became
                        seriously ill. Sensing that his death was imminent, the
                        Imam designated his brother Al-Husayn (a.s.) to be the
                        third Imam. Although Imam Al-Hasan knew he was poisoned,
                        he did not reveal that to anyone but to his brother
                        Al-Husayn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing Al-Hasan had wished was to have his burial by
                        the side of his grandfather, Prophet Muhammad (S). Imam
                        Husayn made all the arrangements to fulfill that wish
                        but Mu'awiya's governor over Medina did not let that
                        happen and used military force to stop it. Imam Al-Hasan
                        was 47 year old when he died of poisoning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Medina was never the same without Imam Hasan (a.s.).
                        Everyone missed him dearly. People at first did not
                        believe Mu'awiya poisoned Imam Al-Hasan, but soon found
                        out the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Husayn (a.s.) was designated as the 3rd Imam he was
                        46 years old. Imam Husayn (a.s.) carried on with his
                        mission of teaching Islam as before. A large number of
                        people kept coming to see him and to learn from him.
                        This process continued for several years when people
                        began to hear an ugly rumor that Mu'awiya wanted his
                        son, Yazid, to succeed him.

                <h2>Mu'awiya Designates Yazid as Successor.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya began a campaign to introduce Monarchy into the
                        structure of Islam. To have Monarchy, by force or
                        otherwise is alien to Islam, an innovation in religion,
                        simply not acceptable. Everyone knew that, for Islam
                        does not subscribe to any form of Royalty through
                        inheritance or Monarchy. In Islam it is supposed to be
                        Shura.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, Mu'awiya sent his agents to the prominent
                        members of the communities to obtain allegiance of
                        loyalty to his son Yazid. But Yazid was evil, of the
                        drinking type, incompetent, contemptible, and a
                        pleasure-seeking person. People knew that. So the people
                        protested vigorously. There was anger everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emotions went sky high. To calm people down, at least
                        temporarily, Mu'awiya decided to send his son Yazid to
                        Mecca for the pilgrimage. Yes, Yazid did go to Mecca but
                        only after taking alcohol with him as well as a chorus
                        of girls for his entertainment.

                <h2>Mu'awiya Dies.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Mu'awiya was getting older day by day. At the age of 75,
                        he became seriously ill. He was nearing death. He lay
                        weak and lifeless as if something was choking and
                        strangling him. He felt tortured and tormented, and
                        continuously cried for mercy. He was in terrible pain.
                        He wanted to die but death would not come close to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His conscience tormented him for the calamities that he
                        brought upon the Islamic Ummah specially Ahlul Bayt.
                        Mu'awiya suffered in agony for many many days. His
                        suffering continued until he breathed his last. At the
                        time of his death, the 30 year old Yazid was nowhere
                        near him, he had gone for fun on a hunting trip.

                        Yazid, and he had named his son after his brother.)

                <h2>Yazid Becomes Ruler.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Upon Mu'awiya's death, Yazid, 30 years old, managed to
                        impose himself on the people and become the Khalifa. At
                        first people refused to accept him as a representative
                        of the Prophet (S) and Islamic Ummah, but Yazid
                        approached people in mosques for their favors. Like his
                        father Mu'awiya, Yazid used all possible means like
                        bribery, coercion, pressure, threats, and force to
                        receive the people's acceptance of him as the legitimate
                        ruler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many people were worried, threats to their lives and
                        livelihood was too menacing, so they grudgingly and
                        reluctantly gave in. But, Imam Husayn (a.s.) and his
                        family (who practiced Islam in its true sense), did not
                        give in. As the true representative of Prophet Muhammad
                        (S), Al-Husayn flatly refused accepting Yazid either as
                        a Khalifa or a leader of Islam. Despite Yazid's
                        intimidating military power the Imam stood firm in his
                        resolve and chose to challenge Bani Umayya's
                        authorities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yazid commissioned Waleed Ibn Ut'ba, his Governor over
                        Medina, to ask for Imam Husayn's allegiance of loyalty
                        or else upon refusal, his head. Waleed invited Al-Husayn
                        to a meeting for the purpose. Imam Husayn did not give
                        his word at the meeting and decided to leave Medina
                        along with his family to proceed to Mecca. When
                        Al-Husayn reached Mecca he received 12,000 letters from
                        Kufa urging him to go to Kufa to be their leader, and be
                        the Khalifa. Imam sent an emissary, his cousin Muslim
                        Ibn Aqeel, to Kufa to ascertain first-hand information
                        about the situation in Iraq.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the meantime Yazid spread a network of informants and
                        secret agents in Mecca to assassinate the Imam during
                        pilgrimage. Imam learned about the spies, and carefully
                        evaluated the situation in Mecca. Imam Husayn knew that
                        Yazid son of Mu'awiya had no regard for Islamic values
                        and teachings, that he would do anything to enforce his
                        tyrannical rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam Husayn also knew that giving allegiance of loyalty
                        to an imposter like Yazid would certainly place Islam at
                        great jeopardy. Therefore he decided to leave Mecca for
                        Kufa to prepare for a confrontation with Yazid and his
                        forces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many friends and relatives urged Imam Husayn not to go
                        to Kufa, but he insisted on going. Imam Husayn, along
                        with family, friends, and companions began the journey
                        toward Kufa (1,100 miles) in a long caravan in the
                        blistering heat of summer.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        During the early phase of the journey the caravan met
                        Al-Farazdaq (a famous poet) at a place called al-Sifah.
                        Al-Farazdaq advised the Imam not to go to Kufa because
                        though people's hearts were with him (Imam), their
                        swords would be against him. But the Imam continued with
                        the journey, and he received the first letter from his
                        emissary Muslim Ibn Aqeel with good news.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The letter indicated that the people were more than
                        ready to welcome the Imam in Kufa and were looking
                        forward to his leadership. Imam Husayn decided to send
                        another emissary to Kufa with a message. The caravan
                        kept proceeding toward Kufa. Many days passed but the
                        Imam did not receive any more responses from Muslim Ibn
                        Aqeel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Kufa Muslim Bin Aqeel with the help of Mukhtar
                        Al-Thaqafi and Hani Ibn Urwah continued to hold secret
                        meetings with the supporters of the Imam. Within a short
                        time the gatherings started to gain momentum. Yazid
                        through his spies and informants learned about Muslim's
                        successes in Kufa. He appointed the tyrant Ubaidullah
                        Ibn Ziyad to replace al-Nu'man Ibn al-Basheer as
                        Governor of Kufa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, as Al-Husayn's caravan got closer to its
                        destination (Kufa), coming to a place called Zubalah,
                        Imam Husayn unexpectedly received shocking news. The
                        shocking news was about Muslim Ibn Aqeel and the person
                        who provided him shelter, Hani's Ibn Urwah, both of whom
                        were arrested and beheaded by the Governor Ibn Ziyad.
                        Mukhtar was also arrested and imprisoned and tortured by
                        Ibn Ziyad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam Husayn gathered his companions and disclosed to
                        them about the bad news, and said, "Our Shi'a have
                        deserted us, those of you who prefer to leave us may do
                        so freely and without guilt." Becoming scared, some
                        companions left the caravan. Imam Husayn continued with
                        the journey along with close companions and family
                        members until he was face to face with 1,000 horsemen
                        led by Hurr al-Riyahi representing the enemy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The enemy army blocked the camps of Imam Husayn (a.s.)
                        from advancing. Tension started to rise between the two.
                        The Imam addressed the enemy explaining to them his
                        motives for going to Kufa, that it was in response to
                        the invitation of the people. He even showed them a
                        bagful of letters he received from Kufa. Hurr said that
                        he and his men were not the writers of those letters.
                        Imam told them that if they did not like him to advance
                        with the journey, he was prepared to return to Hijaz.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hurr replied, "We are commissioned to follow you until
                        we take you to Governor Ibn Ziyad, and suggested to the
                        Imam to go towards a station which is neither Kufa nor
                        Medina." Imam Husayn found the proposal fair and turned
                        the caravan away from Kufa. Hurr and his army marched
                        parallel to the Imam. The two sides reached a village
                        called Nainawa where Ibn Ziyad's messenger (Yazid's
                        governor over Kufa) delivered a message to Hurr.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The message read, " ...force Husayn to a halt. But let
                        him stop in an open space, without vegetation or water."
                        Hurr conveyed the contents of the letter to Imam Husayn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Imam, his family and companions defiantly resumed
                        their journey and reached a place where another enemy
                        force blocked their move and forced them to stop. When
                        Imam Husayn learned that the place was called Karbala,
                        he felt he reached the destination and ordered his camp
                        to be setup. That day was 2nd of Muharram, Hijri 61.

                    <p>
                        Upon learning that his army had succeeded to lay a siege
                        around the Imam's camp, Governor Ibn Ziyad sent
                        additional military units to Karbala and appointed Umar
                        Ibn Sa'ad in charge. Imam Husayn (a.s.) opened a
                        dialogue with Umar Ibn Sa'ad and convinced him to lift
                        the siege so that the Imam with his family and
                        companions could leave Iraq.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Umar Ibn Sa'ad liked the Imam's proposal and sent a
                        message to Governor Ibn Ziyad notifying him about the
                        results of the talks with Imam Husayn (a.s.). Ibn Ziyad
                        also found the Imam's proposal acceptable. However
                        before agreeing to it officially, Shimr Bin
                        Dhil-Jawshan, opposed it strongly. As a result Ziyad
                        wrote a letter to Umar Ibn Sa'ad commanding him to
                        either go to war with Imam Husayn (a.s.) or be relieved
                        of his duties as commander of the army and Shimr would
                        not only replace him but despatch Ibn Sa'ad's head to
                        Kufa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Umar Ibn bin Sa'ad got the letter. After pondering over
                        the consequences he decided to fight Imam Husayn (a.s.).
                        On the 7th day of Muharram he moved his troops closer to
                        the camp and began to surround the Husaini camp. Ibn
                        Sa'ad laid a blockade around the camp to cut it off from
                        access to the river Euphrates, to deprive it of water in
                        a move to force them to surrender.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two days later, (on the 9th of Muharram), the enemy's
                        military forces closed in on the camp of Imam Husayn
                        (a.s.). Imam asked his brother, Abbas, to talk to Ibn
                        Sa'ad and request a delay of the aggression by one
                        night. Umar Ibn Sa'ad agreed to the demand. He ordered
                        his troops to delay the aggression till next morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam Husayn and his pious companions spent that night in
                        prayers. During the night the Imam told the companions,
                        " ....the enemy is interested in none but me, me alone.
                        I'll be most delighted to permit each and every one of
                        you to go back, and I urge you to do so...." All
                        companions screamed in response, "By Allah, never,
                        never! We will either live with you or die together with
                        you."

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the day of Ashuraa dawned upon the soil of
                        Karbala. It was the day when Jihad would be in full
                        bloom, blood would be shed, 72 innocent lives would be
                        sacrificed, and a decisive battle would be won to save
                        Islam and the Ummah.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It had been a few days since the water supply was cut
                        off by the enemy. Children were crying for water, the
                        women were desperate for water, Zainul-Abideen, the son
                        of Imam Husayn (a.s.) was sick with fever. The suffering
                        from the thirst was too painful to bear. And despite
                        this, not a single person in the camp made any
                        complaints or even questioned the mission of Imam
                        Husayn. Each member supported the Imam wholeheartedly
                        and enthusiastically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next morning Imam Husayn (a.s.) went out of the camp and
                        saw Umar Ibn Sa'ad mobilizing his troops to start the
                        hostility. He stared at the intimidating army, and as
                        large as it was Imam Husayn showed no signs of
                        compromise. Imam Husayn raised his hands in prayer:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "O Allah! It is Thee in whom I trust amid all grief. You
                        are my hope amid all violence. Thou are my refuge and
                        provision in everything that happens to me. How many
                        grievances weaken the heart, leaving me with no means to
                        handle them, during which friend deserts me, and enemy
                        rejoices in it. I lay it before Thee and complain of it
                        to Thee, because of my desire in Thee, Thee alone. You
                        relieve me of it and remove it from me. Thou are the
                        Master of all Grace, the Essence of Goodness, and the
                        Ultimate Resort of all Desire."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the actual engagement was to take place, Hurr,
                        the previous commander of the enemy force, felt his
                        conscience violently stirring, he was in turmoil. Upon
                        realizing the gravity of the situation, he suddenly
                        broke away from Umar Ibn Sa'ad's camp (along with two
                        others). They rushed toward Imam Husayn (a.s.) to join
                        his camp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hurr's heart was jumping with joy, his mind relieved of
                        an agonizing tension. Hurr's defection worried Umar Ibn
                        Sa'ad very much, lest others do the same and defect. So
                        Umar Ibn Sa'ad threw an arrow in the air to indicate the
                        start of the battle. This was the outset of a
                        catastrophe and a tragic event that Mu'awiya had once
                        conceived to happen.

                <h2>The Battle.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Imam Husayn's supporters insisted on being the first to
                        fight. Therefore, they took the brunt of the enemy
                        attack. The battle was ferocious. Within a short time
                        the Imam's supporters slay a large number of the enemy
                        fighters; they were on the offensive and the enemy on
                        the defensive. This caused apprehension and confusion in
                        the enemy military, the 72 of Husayn's against the 5,000
                        of the enemy (some say 30,000) being on the defensive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So worried and nervous, the enemy commander-in-chief
                        ordered his army not only to set fire to the Imam's
                        tents (which were occupied mostly by frightened females
                        and children), but at the same time reinforced his
                        fighters with more troops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The heroes began to fall, they were men of valor
                        welcoming martyrdom, and they fell one after another,
                        for the enemy was overwhelming in number. By noon time
                        the Imam stopped the fight to perform the Salat
                        (prayer). By this time those left were mainly his family
                        and a few supporters. They performed the Salat together.
                        Two supporters were guarding the performers of Salat.
                        The enemy was standing still, watching!! When Salat was
                        finished one of the guards fell dead; there were 17
                        arrows in his back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‘Ali Akbar, Husayn's son obtained permission to fight
                        and dashed toward the enemy. He engaged them in fierce
                        fighting, falling on them like thunder, slaying numerous
                        fighters. He continued to move forward, deep inside the
                        enemy. The enemy was overpowering in number, it
                        overwhelmed him cutting him with swords and spears, and
                        his body became nothing but wounds gushing blood, until
                        he died.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam Husayn (a.s.) rushed to the area and picked up the
                        wounded limp body and brought it to the appalled camp.
                        His sister and others in the camp were horrified and
                        shocked at the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abbas and five other brothers of Imam Husayn went to
                        fight. They also engaged the enemy in a fierce fighting,
                        almost doing the impossible. Abbas went toward the river
                        to bring some water for the thirsty children. While he
                        was returning on his horse with the water, he was
                        attacked by a large horde of the enemy, overwhelming and
                        severely wounding him. As much as he tried Abbas could
                        not save the water, he fell from his horse to breath his
                        last.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next to the battle field went the sons of Imam Al-Hasan
                        and Zainab and their cousins (about 17 of them). They
                        were all in their teens but each stood bravely,
                        believing in the mission, facing a formidable enemy, and
                        showed no less enthusiasm in their quest to embrace the
                        martyrdom.

                <h2>Al-Husayn and His Baby.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        By the afternoon 70 brave persons had sacrificed their
                        lives in Karbala to save Islam. All had fought under
                        nerve racking conditions, severe thirst, dehydration,
                        exhaustion, and agonizing feeling of what would happen
                        to the family of the Prophet (S) afterwards. Husayn
                        endured all that and more, for he saw all his beloved
                        ones brutally cut to pieces, including children.
                        Remaining the only one, Imam Husayn was to face the
                        enemy head on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Precisely at that moment Imam Husayn heard his baby
                        crying incessantly, agonizing because of the thirst.
                        Imam Husayn's love for his family was unbound,
                        especially for a suffering baby. He held the six months
                        old baby, his youngest son (‘Ali Asghar) in his arms,
                        and appealed to the enemy fighters for some water for
                        the baby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imam wanted to awaken their conscience and stir their
                        human feelings but the stone-hearted enemy, instead of
                        giving water, zoomed an arrow toward the agonizing baby
                        and killed him instantly. Imam Husayn was shocked. He
                        felt an unbearable wave of pain. The sight of the limp
                        baby in his arms was agonizingly painful. He filled his
                        palm with the blood of the baby, and threw it upwards
                        toward the sky, complaining to Allah (swt),
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "O' Allah, O' my Lord! My consolation is the fact that
                        Thou in Thine Majesty are witnessing what I am going
                        through."

                <h2>Al-Husayn by Himself.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Imam Husayn (a.s.) was alone, one man against thousands.
                        He took them on, fighting them bravely, and kept
                        fighting, receiving many wounds in the process.
                        Thousands of enemy fighters were surrounding him but
                        none dared to move toward him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The silence was broken when Shimr screamed for an
                        attack, and then screamed again, threatening, and in
                        response they attacked collectively, and one sword fell
                        on Imam Husayn's left wrist and deeply cut his left
                        hand. The blood gushed like a fountain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another sword was soon to follow and it hit his upper
                        back. Imam Husayn (a.s.) felt numb as he fell to the
                        ground, bleeding profusely. He was near the point of
                        shock, even though staggering he tried to stand by
                        leaning on his sword. Then he received the fatal blow.

                        It was at this point, that Shimr whose mother was a
                        disbeliever, came forward and severed Imam Husayn's
                        noble head from the body, the noble head kissed often by
                        the Prophet (S)! Shimr and others had the audacity to
                        carry it on the tip of a spear to Yazid, 600 miles away!

                    <p>
                        Umar Ibn Sa'ad ordered the horsemen to trample upon the
                        supine bodies of Imam Husayn and all others killed, to
                        disfigure them even further, as if the wounds, the
                        bloodied bodies, and the headless forms were not enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For three days the exposed bodies of the martyrs were
                        left lying in the desert of Karbala. Afterwards, the
                        people of the tribe of Bani-Asad, who were not far away
                        from the battle field, helped bury them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Umar Ibn Sa'ad and his forces (representing Bani Umayya)
                        took the women and children as prisoners in shackles,
                        put them on camels, and proceeded in a caravan from
                        Karbala to Kufa. At the forefront of the procession were
                        the heads of Imam Husayn (a.s.) and his followers on the
                        tip of spears. The scene was both grotesque and
                        pathetic. This was the leftover of the beloved family of
                        Prophet Muhammad (S), in such a deplorable unimaginable
                        condition, all caused by people who called themselves
                        Muslims!

                <h2>Lessons from the Tragedy of <span class="red">Karbala</span>.</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Karbala is the cruelest tragedy humanity has ever seen.
                        Yet, the startling (though appalling) events in Karbala
                        proved like a powerful volcano that shook the very
                        foundation of Muslims, it stirred their consciousness,
                        ignorant or learned alike. For sincere Muslims, Karbala
                        turned into a triumph. The tragic event became the very
                        beacon of light to always remind Muslims to practice
                        Islam honestly and sincerely, to do what is right
                        irrespective of consequences, and fear no one except
                        Allah (swt).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Yazid never achieved what he and his
                        father had planned to achieve, for within three years,
                        Allah's wrath fell upon him, causing him to die at the
                        age of 33 years. And within a few decades the rule of
                        Bani Umayya crumbled and came to an end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tragedy of Karbala taught humanity a lesson that
                        standing for the truth and fighting unto death for it is
                        more honorable and valuable than submitting to the
                        wrongful, especially when the survival of Islam is at
                        stake.
